# emojiwords
### Create words with Slack emojis

There are currently two supported languages to achieve this: 
* Scala 
* Go (only compatible with Mac OS)

You need to provide two parameters to a script - the word you want to spell and the name of the emoji in Slack.

Scala example: ``./scala-emojiwords.sh hello partyparrot``

Go example: ``./go-emojiwords.sh hello partyparrot``
